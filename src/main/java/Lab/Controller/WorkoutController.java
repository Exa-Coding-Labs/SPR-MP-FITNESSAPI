/**
 * Recall that @Controller is a stereotype annotation introduced by Spring MVC (model/view/controller), which
 * allows for the creation of a Component which follows a stereotype Controller pattern. This means that the class can
 * be used to create web endpoints. The @RestController annotation exhibits all the behavior of @Controller, but it
 * also includes the behavior of @ResponseBody, which automatically converts the Objects that are returned by the
 * endpoint methods into JSON response bodies.
 *
 * For the purpose of completing any challenges within this project: do not change anything within this class!
 * It is already complete.
